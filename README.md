> [!NOTE]
> I realize that this project technically cuts into Trakt's business model. Realistically, this is a very niche contraption for people that probably want to leave the Trakt platform regardless, like I did years ago with Simkl. I think "CSV Exports" are far enough down the selling point list that this is entirely irrelevant. Plus, there are similar projects out there, just without the nice UI. My personal opinion hardly matters, but it's very annoying that I have to pay a monthly fee to takeout the data that **I myself** have put into the Trakt platform.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traktarr.git
   cd traktarr
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```

   yarn install
   ```

### Creating a Trakt Application (Required)

> [!WARNING]
> This section is for **nerds**! If you just want to use the app, you can skip this part and use the hosted version - it will have better instructions.

This app uses a "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) approach, meaning you need to create your own Trakt application to get API credentials:

1. Go to [Trakt API Applications](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications)
2. Sign in to your Trakt account (or create one if you don't have it)
3. Click on "New Application"
4. Fill in the application details:
   - **Name**: Traktarr (or any name you prefer)
   - **Description**: Personal app for exporting my Trakt data
   - **Redirect URI**:
     - `http://localhost:5173/auth` (for local development)
     - `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob` (**required** for device authentication)
   - **JavaScript Origins**: 
     - `http://localhost:5173`
5. Click "Save App"
6. You'll now see your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
7. Copy these values for use in the dashboard

8. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```
   yarn dev
   ```

9. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Building for Production

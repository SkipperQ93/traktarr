## Getting Started (Development)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher
- npm 10.7.0 or higher (or yarn 4.8.1+)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traktarr.git
   cd traktarr
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```
   yarn install
   ```

### Creating a Trakt Application (Required)

This app uses a "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) approach, meaning you need to create your own Trakt application to get API credentials:

1. Go to [Trakt API Applications](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications)
2. Sign in to your Trakt account (or create one if you don't have it)
3. Click on "New Application"
4. Fill in the application details:
   - **Name**: Traktarr (or any name you prefer)
   - **Description**: Personal app for exporting my Trakt data
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:5173/auth` (for local development)
   - **JavaScript Origins**: 
     - `http://localhost:5173`
     - `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob` (you need both, especially that last one for device authentication)
5. Click "Save App"
6. You'll now see your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
7. Copy these values for use in the dashboard

8. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```
   yarn dev
   ```

9. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Building for Production

To build the app for production:

```
npm run build
```
or
```
yarn build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.
